# Macbeth: the Scottish ~~Play~~ Videogame!

A (hopefully) educational videogame version of Macbeth, performed on a real-ish stage by pixels made to resemble actors. It's... pretty experimental.

## Motivation
I'm making this for my senior project at university!
We were tasked with coming up with a project that works to solve a non-trivial problem, so my idea was to put my past theatre experience and computer science experience
together in order to create a videogame that functions as a performance of Shakespeare's tragedy, Macbeth!

Pretty much every student in high school and college will, at some point, be expected to read and understand some of Shakespeare's plays for an English class.
The problem is that not only is the language old to our modern senses, but the text can be very dense and difficult to parse.

So, my solution to this problem was to create a videogame "performance" of Macbeth-- because it's a play, and plays are really meant to be performed and watched, not just read!

Along with this, to help to make it less intimidating for someone reading this all for the first time, there is a study dashboard which can be accessed by the user at any time,
and contains tabs that help explain what's going on. There is a translation tab, from the play's English into modern English, a tab that includes the definitions of more
obscure words, and a tab that will talk about some of the literary devices and motifs used by Shakespeare (yes, I went through AP English in high school haha)

## Framework used

To make this, I am using the LibGDX Java game development library, along with the Artemis ECS framework.
